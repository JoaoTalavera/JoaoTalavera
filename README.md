Hi, I’m @JoaoTalavera.

I’m just starting to study and I'm planning on be a lot around here.

I’m currently learning how to code in JAVA and soon I will move to Python and C++.

I’m looking to collaborate on everything I can, so I can learn with every single person that has at least 1 new thing to teach me.

You can reach me through my email: joaotalavera@gmail.com.
